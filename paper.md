# Introduction

The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) is an open source, parallel, high-resolution ice sheet model written in C++.

# Key Functionality

Features include:
  * extensible atmospheric/ocean coupling
  * hybrid shallow stress balance
  * marine ice sheet physics
  * polythermal energy conservation
  * subglacial hydrology and till model
  * complete overview|documentation
  * parallel simulations using [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) & [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/)
  * reads and writes [CF-compliant](http://cfconventions.org/) [NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)
  * verification and validation tools
