//! \brief The PISM subglacial hydrology model interface.
/*!
  This is a virtual base class.

  The purpose of this class and its derived classes is to provide
  \code
  subglacial_water_thickness(IceModelVec2S &result)
  subglacial_water_pressure(IceModelVec2S &result)
  till_water_thickness(IceModelVec2S &result)
  \endcode
  These correspond to state variables \f$W\f$, \f$P\f$, and \f$W_{\text{til}}\f$
  in [\ref BuelervanPeltDRAFT], though not all derived classes of Hydrology
  have all of them as state variables.

  Additional modeled fields, for diagnostic purposes, are
  \code
  overburden_pressure(IceModelVec2S &result)
  wall_melt(IceModelVec2S &result)
  \endcode

  This interface is appropriate to subglacial hydrology models which track a
  two-dimensional water layer with a well-defined thickness and pressure at each
  map-plane location.  The methods subglacial_water_thickness() and
  subglacial_water_pressure() return amount and pressure of the *transportable*
  water, that is, the subglacial water which moves along a modeled hydraulic
  head gradient, in contrast to the water stored in the till.

  The transportable water moves through a subglacial morphology which is not
  determined in this base class.

  The Hydrology models have separate, but potentially-coupled, water
  which is held in local till storage.  Thus the
  transportable water (bwat) and till water (tillwat) thicknesses are different.
  Published models with till storage include [\ref BBssasliding, \ref SchoofTill,
  \ref TrufferEchelmeyerHarrison2001, \ref Tulaczyketal2000b, \ref vanderWeletal2013].

  The till water thickness is can be used, via the theory of
  [\ref Tulaczyketal2000], to compute an effective pressure for the water in the
  pore spaces of the till, which can then be used by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion
  to provide a yield stress.  Class MohrCoulombYieldStress does this
  calculation.  Here in Hydrology only the till water thickness tillwat is
  computed.

  Hydrology is a timestepping component (Component_TS).  Because of the
  short physical timescales associated to liquid water moving under a glacier,
  Hydrology (and derived) classes generally take many substeps in PISM's major
  ice dynamics time steps.  Thus when an update() method in a Hydrology
  class is called it will advance its internal time to the new goal t+dt
  using its own internal time steps.

  Generally Hydrology classes use the ice geometry, the basal melt
  rate, and the basal sliding velocity in determining the evolution of the
  hydrology state variables.  Note that the basal melt rate is an
  energy-conservation-derived field and the basal-sliding velocity is derived
  from the solution of a stress balance.  The basal melt rate and
  sliding velocity fields therefore generally come from IceModel and
  StressBalance, respectively.

  Additional, time-dependent and spatially-variable water input to the basal
  layer, taken directly from a file, is possible too.

  Ice geometry and energy fields are normally treated as constant in time
  during the update() call for the interval [t,t+dt].  Thus the coupling is
  one-way during the update() call.

//! \brief A subglacial hydrology model which assumes water pressure
//! equals overburden pressure.
/*!
  This is the minimal PISM hydrology model that has lateral motion of
  subglacial water and which conserves the water mass.  It was promised
  as a PISM addition in in Bueler's talk at IGS 2012 Fairbanks:
  http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/bueler-igs-fairbanks-june2012.pdf
  Further documentation is in [\ref BuelervanPeltDRAFT].

  The water velocity is along the steepest descent route for the hydraulic
  potential.  This potential is (mostly) a function of ice sheet geometry,
  because the water pressure is set to the overburden pressure, a simplified but
  well-established model [\ref Shreve1972].  However, the water layer thickness
  is also a part of the hydraulic potential because it is actually the potential
  of the \i top of the water layer.

  This (essential) model has been used for finding locations of subglacial lakes
  [\ref Siegertetal2009, \ref Livingstoneetal2013TCD].  Subglacial lakes occur
  at local minima of the hydraulic potential.  If water builds up significantly
  (e.g. thickness of 10s of meters or more) then in the model here the resulting
  lakes diffuse instead of becoming infinitely deep.  Thus we avoid delta
  functions of water thickness at the minima of the hydraulic potential in this
  well-posed model.

  This model should generally be tested using static ice geometry first, i.e.
  using option -no_mass.

  Use option `-report_mass_accounting` to see stdout reports which balance the
  books on this model.

  The state space includes both the till water effective thickness \f$W_{til}\f$,
  which is in Hydrology, and the transportable water layer thickness \f$W\f$.

  For more complete modeling where the water pressure is determined by a
  physical model for the opening and closing of cavities, and where the state
  space includes a nontrivial pressure variable, see DistributedHydrology.

  There is an option `-hydrology_null_strip` `X` which produces a strip of
  `X` km around the edge of the computational domain.  In that strip the water flow
  velocity is set to zero.  The water amount is also reset to zero at the end
  of each time step in this strip (in an accounted way).

  As noted this is the minimal model which has a lateral water flux.  This flux is
  \f[ \mathbf{q} = - K \nabla \psi = \mathbf{V} W - D \nabla W \f]
  where \f$\psi\f$ is the hydraulic potential
  \f[ \psi = P + \rho_w g (b + W). \f]
  The generalized conductivity \f$K\f$ is nontrivial and it generally also
  depends on the water thickness:
  \f[ K = k W^{\alpha-1} |\nabla (P+\rho_w g b)|^{\beta-2}. \f]

  This model contains enough information (enough modeled fields) so that we can
  compute the wall melt generated by dissipating the gravitational
  potential energy in the moving, presumably turbulent, subglacial water.  If we
  suppose that this heat is dissipated immediately as melt on the
  cavity/conduit walls then we get a formula for a wall melt contribution.  (This
  is in addition to the `bmelt` field coming from conserving energy in the flowing
  ice.)  See wall_melt().  At this time the wall melt is diagnostic only and does
  not add to the water amount W; such an addition is generally unstable.

//! \brief The PISM subglacial hydrology model for a distributed linked-cavity system.
/*!
  This class implements the model documented in [\ref BuelervanPeltDRAFT].

  Unlike RoutingHydrology, the water pressure \f$P\f$ is a state variable, and there
  are modeled mechanisms for cavity geometry evolution, including creep closure
  and opening through sliding ("cavitation").  Because of cavitation, this model
  needs access to a StressBalance object.   Background references for this kind of
  model includes especially [\ref Kamb1987, \ref Schoofetal2012], but see also
  [\ref Hewit2011, \ref Hewittetal2012, \ref Hewitt2013].

  In addition to the actions within the null strip taken by RoutingHydrology,
  this model also sets the staggered grid values of the gradient of the hydraulic
  potential to zero if either regular grid neighbor is in the null strip.
