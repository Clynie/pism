/*! \brief PISM iceberg remover */
/*!
 * Identifies and removes free-floating icebergs, which cause
 * well-posedness problems for stress solvers.
 *
 * Icebergs are, in this context, floating regions that are _not_
 * attached, through a chain of positive thickness ice-filled cells,
 * to at least one grounded cell.
 *
 * They cause the SSA operator to have a nontrivial null space.
 *
 * They are observed to cause unrealistically large velocities that
 * may affect ice velocities elsewhere.
 *
 * This class uses a serial connected component labeling algorithm to
 * remove "icebergs".
