//! Virtual base class.  Abstracts a tridiagonal system to solve in a column of ice and/or bedrock.
/*!
  Because both the age evolution and conservation of energy equations require us to set up
  and solve a tridiagonal system of equations, this is structure is worth abstracting.

  This base class just holds the tridiagonal system and the ability to
  solve it, but does not insert entries into the relevant matrix locations.
  Derived classes will actually set up instances of the system.

  The sequence requires setting the column-independent (public) data members,
  calling the initAllColumns() routine, and then setting up and solving
  the system in each column.

  The tridiagonal algorithm here comes from Numerical Recipes in C
  Section 2.4, page 50.  It solves the system:

  [b_1  c_1   0   ...                           ] [  u_1  ]   [   r_1   ]
  [a_2  b_2  c_2  ...                           ] [  u_2  ]   [   r_2   ]
  [               ...                           ].[  ...  ] = [   ...   ]
  [               ...  a_{N-1}  b_{N-1}  c_{N-1}] [u_{N-1}]   [ r_{N-1} ]
  [               ...     0     a_N      b_N    ] [  u_N  ]   [   r_N   ]

  HOWEVER... the version in this code is different from Numerical
  Recipes in two ways:
  a) Indexing is zero-based
  b) Variables have been renamed.

  NR      PISM
  ==================
  a       L       "Lower Diagonal" (L doesn't use index 0)
  b       D       "Diagonal"
  c       U       "Upper Diagonal"
  u       x
  r       rhs
  bet     b
  j       k
  n       n
  gam     work


  Therefore... this version of the code solves the following problem:

  [D_0  U_0   0   ...                           ] [  x_0  ]   [   r_0   ]
  [L_1  D_1  U_1  ...                           ] [  x_1  ]   [   r_1   ]
  [               ...                           ].[  ...  ] = [   ...   ]
  [               ...  L_{N-2}  D_{N-2}  U_{N-2}] [x_{N-2}]   [ r_{N-2} ]
  [               ...     0     L_{N-1}  D_{N-1}] [x_{N-1}]   [ r_{N-1} ]
