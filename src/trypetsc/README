This directory contains simple example PETSc source codes.  They are by
the PISM authors but are close to PETSc example codes anyway.  All of these
examples relate to "PETSc-technicalities" of relevance to PISM.

Compiling and running these allows a user to test whether PETSc itself is
installed properly, as a way of testing PETSc before building PISM.
These examples should compile under PETSc 2.3.3 or 3.0.0 or 3.1.?
is installed properly.  These examples do not depend on other libraries needed
by PISM, such as NetCDF and FFTW.

EXAMPLE for testing PETSc installation
-----------------------

$ make poisson
$ ./poisson
entering FormJacobianLocal() ...
entering FormJacobianLocal() ...
 10 x  10 grid: number of Newton iterations = 2
                max abs(residual) = |residual|_infty = 1.653e-11
                max abs(u_NUM-u_EXACT) = |u_NUM-u_EXACT|_infty = 3.614e-02

BUILD ERRORS
-----------------------
If there is an error 
   "makefile: ... /bmake/common/base: No such file or directory"
or similar then
   ***  PETSC_DIR is not set properly  ***
   ***  see PISM Installation Manual  ***

If there is an error
   "..../bmake/FOO/petscconf: No such file or directory"
or similar then
   ***  PETSC_ARCH is not set properly (as it is set to FOO)  ***
   ***  see PISM Installation Manual  ***
