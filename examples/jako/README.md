Jakobshavn outlet glacier regional modeling example
=================

This directory contains all of the scripts needed to build a PISM regional model
of Jakobshavn Isbrae in the Greenland ice sheet.  The same strategy will
work for other outlet glaciers.  The base data is the SeaRISE 1km
Greenland dataset for the whole ice sheet, plus an earlier lower-resolution
(5km) whole ice sheet spun-up state.  That whole ice sheet state can be
downloaded or regenerated from examples/searise-greenland/ scripts.
This example demonstrates the outlet-glacier-mode PISM executable `pismo`
and the drainage-basin-delineation tool `regional-tools`.
