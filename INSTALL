Welcome to PISM!

All information about PISM can be found at

   www.pism-docs.org
   
To download the latest stable release use git:

   git clone git://github.com/pism/pism.git pism0.6

For complete installation instructions get the PISM Installation Manual (PDF)
from www.pism-docs.org.  Major installation requirements:

  *  You must have MPI (www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/), GSL (www.gnu.org/software/gsl/),
     NetCDF (www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/), and UDUNITS-2 (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/).

  *  PETSc (www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) must be installed and functioning
     before building PISM.  Environment variables PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH
     must be set.  PETSc 3.3 or later is required.

To build PISM locally (within the PISM source tree), do

  $ cd pism0.6
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ ccmake ..     # hit 'c' to see initial config, 'c' again to configure,
                  # and then 'g' to generate once settings look right
  $ make install

Check where PISM executables can be found by:

  $ which pismr

Run a simplified geometry experiment on one MPI process:

  $ pisms

Everything is working if this run goes for 1000 model years and ends with
"... done with run".  Again but with 2 MPI processes:

  $ mpiexec -n 2 pisms

A more thorough test of the build requires tools (esp. python and NCO):

  $ make test

Please see the PISM User's Manual, also at www.pism-docs.org.  It
explains actual ice sheet modeling with PISM.

To generate PDF documentation:

  cd 'your build directory'
  make manual              # builds manual.pdf
  make installation        # builds installation.pdf
  make forcing             # builds forcing.pdf

To generate Doxygen source code documentation:

  make browser             # doxygen docs; view doc/browser/html/index.html when done
