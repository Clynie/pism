Welcome to PISM!

All information about PISM can be found at

   www.pism-docs.org
   
To download the latest stable version use subversion:

   svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/pism/tags/stable0.3 pism0.3

For complete installation instructions get the PISM Installation Manual (PDF)
from www.pism-docs.org.

Intallation high points:  PETSc (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) must be
installed and functioning before PISM can be built, so we assume now that
PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set properly.  If FFTW is not available do 
"export WITH_FFTW=0".  Now do:

  $ cd pism0.3/
  $ make
  $ PATH=bin/:util/:$PATH

Now run a simplified geometry experiment with 2 processes

  $ mpiexec -n 2 pisms

To get source code updates including bug fixes, do

  $ svn up

We have written a good PISM User's Manual (PDF) which will explain most of what
you want to know.  Find it at (you guessed it ...) www.pism-docs.org.
