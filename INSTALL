Welcome to PISM!

All information about PISM can be found at

   www.pism-docs.org
   
To download the latest stable release use git:

  $ git clone git@github.com:pism/pism.git pism0.4

For complete installation instructions get the PISM Installation Manual (PDF)
from www.pism-docs.org.

Intallation high points:  PETSc (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) must be
installed and functioning before PISM can be built.  We assume now that
PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set properly.

To install PISM locally (in the PISM source tree), do

  $ cd pism0.4
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..     # do 'c' then check that flags are right, then generate
  $ make install

You can check that PISM executables can be found by running:

  $ which pismr

and this should tell you a directory in which executable "pismr" is found.

You can test the build by running a suite of software/regression tests:

  $ make test

Now run a simplified geometry experiment on 1 processor:

  $ pisms

Everything is working if this run goes for 1000 model years and ends with
"... done with run".  Again but with 2 MPI processes:

  $ mpiexec -n 2 pisms

Please see the Installation Manual at www.pism-docs.org for more information on
the build process.  The PISM User's Manual, also at www.pism-docs.org, will
explain most of what you want to know to do ice sheet modeling with PISM.

If you have questions about PISM usage, installation, or creating new models,
e-mail us at <help@pism-docs.org>.
