Welcome!

PETSc must be installed and functioning before PISM can be built.
See http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/.

Assuming PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set properly, do this:

  $ make

If FFTW is not available do "export WITH_FFTW=0" before make.

More complete installation information, including on installing
PETSc and other libraries used by PISM, is in the PISM 
Installation Manual, at
  
  http://www.pism-docs.org/installation0.2.pdf
