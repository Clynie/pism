NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction (MAP) program grant #NNX13AM16G and NASA
Cryospheric Sciences program grant #NNX13AK27G support the development of PISM from 2013
to 2017. NASA MAP grant #NNX09AJ38G supported the development of PISM from 2009 to 2013.
Development from 2002 to 2008 was supported by the NASA Cryospheric Sciences program.

The Snow, Ice, and Permafrost group at the Geophysical Institute is the home for the
University of Alaska PISM developers; find us in Elvey 410D. The Arctic Region
Supercomputing Center (now RCS) has provided significant computational resources and
technical help in the development of PISM.
