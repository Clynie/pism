.. math::

   \newcommand{\Diff}[2]{ \frac{\mathrm{d}#1}{\mathrm{d}#2} }
   \newcommand{\diff}[2]{ \frac{\partial #1}{\partial #2} }

.. Unfortunately \newcommand included in a math environment in LaTeX
   is limited to this environment, so we need to define custom
   commands twice: once for HTML (MathJax), once for LaTeX.

   (This has to be done for all \newcommands, including ones defined elsewhere.)

.. raw:: latex

   \newcommand{\Diff}[2]{ \frac{\mathrm{d}#1}{\mathrm{d}#2} }
   \newcommand{\diff}[2]{ \frac{\partial #1}{\partial #2} }
