#. The availability of a diagnostic depends on modeling choices. For example, the bed
   uplift rate :var:`dbdt` is available only if a bed deformation model is selected.
#. Some scalar diagnostics come in two versions: the ``_glacierized`` and
   ``_nonglacierized``. Here the former account for the ice
   :config:`output.ice_free_thickness_standard` meters or thicker (10 meters by default)
   and the latter include all ice regardless of the thickness. "Glacierized" versions were
   added to make it easier to analyze changes in glacier volumes and areas and exclude
   changes in the seasonal snow cover.
