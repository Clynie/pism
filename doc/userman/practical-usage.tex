PISM is a program that reads NetCDF files and then outputs NetCDF files.  Table \ref{tab:input-output-options} summarizes command-line options controlling the most basic input and output of NetCDF files relating to starting and ending PISM runs.

\begin{table}[h]

  \begin{tabular}{lp{0.6\linewidth}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Option} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule
    \fileopt{i} & Chooses a PISM output file to restart from.  (``Restart'' because normally the first PISM run must come from data by bootstrapping (\intextoption{boot_file}) or using executables \texttt{pisms} or \texttt{pismv}.) \\
    \fileopt{o} & Chooses the output file name.  Default name is \texttt{unnamed.nc} under \texttt{pismr}, \texttt{simp_exper.nc} under \texttt{pisms}, and \texttt{verify.nc} under \texttt{pismv}.\\
    \txtopt{o_size}{[small, medium, big]} & Chooses the ``size'' of the output file to produce.
    Possible options are \texttt{small} (only variables necessary to restart
    PISM), \texttt{medium} (the default, includes some diagnostic quantities)
    and \texttt{big} (writes all the variables mentioned in table
    \ref{tab:extra-vars}).  Configuration variables \texttt{output_medium} and \texttt{output_big} list the written variables for those sizes. \\
    \intextoption{dontreadSSAvels} & Turns off reading the \texttt{ubar_ssa}
    and \texttt{vbar_ssa} velocities saved by a previous
    \texttt{-ssa_floating_only} or \texttt{-ssa_sliding} run. \\

Table \ref{tab:stdout} gives a summary of PISM's options controlling
what is printed to the standard output.  This includes the \texttt{-help} and \texttt{-usage} options for getting help at the command line.

   \intextoption{verbose} & Increased verbosity of standard output.  Usually given with an integer level; 0,1,2,3,4,5 are allowed.  At the extremes, \texttt{-verbose 0} produces no stdout at all, \texttt{-verbose 1} prints only warnings and a few high priority messages, and \texttt{-verbose 5} spews a lot of usually-undesirable stuff.  \texttt{-verbose 3} adds a bit more about initialization, especially.

The following sections describe more input and output options, especially related to saving quantities during a run, or adding to the ``diagnostic'' outputs of PISM.

\subsubsection{PISM file I/O performance}
\label{sec:pism-io-performance}

When working with fine grids\footnote{Resolutions of 2km and higher on the
  whole-Greenland scale is an example.}, the time PISM spends writing output,
spatial time-series or backup files can become significant.

It turns out that it is a lot faster to read and write files using the
\texttt{t,x,y,z} storage order, as opposed to the more convenient
\texttt{t,z,y,x} order.

The reason is that PISM uses the \texttt{x,y,z} order internally\footnote{This
  is not likely to change.} and transposing an array stored in memory is an
inherently computationally expensive operation, because it involves
simultaneously accessing memory locations that are ``far away'' from each
other.

To transpose dimensions in an existing file, use the \texttt{ncpdq} (``permute
dimensions quickly'') tool from the NCO (\emph{NetCDF Operators}) suite.

Run
\begin{verbatim}
$ ncpdq -a t,z,zb,y,x bad.nc good.nc
\end{verbatim}%$
to turn \texttt{bad.nc} (with an unspecified inconvenient storage order) into
\texttt{good.nc} using the \texttt{t,z,y,x} order.

You can also re-compile PISM to change the default storage order of PISM output
files: look for the \texttt{Pism_VARIABLE_ORDER} CMake flag.

\subsection{Saving time series of scalar diagnostic quantities}\index{time-series}\index{PISM!saving time-series}
\label{sec:saving-time-series}
\optsection{Saving scalar time-series}
 It is also possible to save time-series of certain scalar diagnostic quantities using a combination of the options \texttt{-ts_file}, \texttt{-ts_times}, and \texttt{-ts_vars}.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
$ pismr -i foo.nc -y 1e4 -o output.nc -ts_file time-series.nc \
        -ts_times 0:1:1e4 -ts_vars ivol,iareag
\end{verbatim} %$ just to make emacs happy
will run for 10000 years, saving total ice volume and grounded ice area to \texttt{time-series.nc} \emph{yearly}. See tables \ref{tab:time-series-opts} for the list of options and \ref{tab:time-series} for the full list of supported time-series.

Note that, similarly to the snapshot-saving code, this mechanism does not affect adaptive time-stepping.  Here, however, PISM will save exactly the number of time-series records requested, \emph{linearly interpolated onto requested times}.

Omitting the \texttt{-ts_vars} option makes PISM save a default list of variables, as listed in table \ref{tab:time-series}.  Because scalar time-series take very little storage space, compared to spatially-varying data, this is usually a reasonable choice.

The non-default variables listed in table \ref{tab:time-series} can be harder to interpret.  They are all time derivatives of PISM quantities.  They are correctly-computed at the user-specified times, but, unless very fine temporal resolution is used when reporting them, they may sample the fast (e.g.~subannual) variability of the PISM model state so infrequently that the resulting time series is unusable.  For example, consider options \texttt{-ts_times 0:10:100000 -ts_vars divoldt,ivol} in the case of SeaRISE-Greenland, which has an annual cycle driving its surface mass balance.  In this case the value \texttt{divoldt} will always be positive, at the user-specified times, \emph{because in January the ice sheet is always gaining volume}.  (Note that integer years mean 1 January.)  Thus a flat \texttt{ivol} time series and a flat but significantly-positive \texttt{divoldt} is expected and correct, at the above times, even when the ice sheet model is in steady state, when the yearly-averaged \texttt{divoldt} is nearly zero.

If the file \texttt{foo.nc}, specified by \texttt{-ts_file foo.nc}, already exists then by default the existing file will be moved to \texttt{foo.nc~} and the new time series will go into \texttt{foo.nc}.  To append the time series onto the end of the existing file, use option \texttt{-ts_append}.

If a PISM input file contains the \texttt{mapping} variable which has the
\texttt{grid_mapping_name} attribute, PISM computes corrected cell areas
using stored latitude and longitude fields and the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.
This allows us to compute areas and volumes (see table \ref{tab:time-series})
more accurately.

PISM buffers time-series data and writes it at the end of the run or once 10000
values are stored, whichever comes first. Sending an \texttt{USR1} (or
\texttt{USR2}) signal to a PISM process flushes these buffers, making it
possible to monitor the run. (See section \ref{subsect:signal} for more about
PISM's signal handling.)

\subsection{Saving time series of spatially-varying diagnostic quantities}
\label{sec:saving-spat-vari}
\optsection{Saving 2D and 3D time-series}
\index{PISM!saving diagnostic quantities regularly}
\index{PISM!diagnostic quantities}

Sometimes it is useful to have PISM save a handful of diagnostic quantities every 10 years (or even every year).  One can use snapshots (section \ref{sec:snapshots}), but doing so can easily fill your hard-drive because snapshots are complete (re-startable) model states.  Sometimes you want a \emph{subset} of model variables saved reasonably-frequently in an output file.

Use options \texttt{-extra_file}, \texttt{-extra_times}, and \texttt{-extra_vars} for this.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
$ pismr -i foo.nc -y 10000 -o output.nc -extra_file extras.nc \
        -extra_times 0:10:1e4 -extra_vars csurf,cbase
\end{verbatim}
will run for 10000 years, saving the magnitude of horizontal velocities at the ice surface and at the base of ice every 10 years. Times are specified using a comma-separated list or a MATLAB-style range. Please see table \ref{tab:extras} for all the options corresponding to this feature; table \ref{tab:extra-vars} lists all the variable choices. 

If the file \texttt{foo.nc}, specified by \texttt{-extra_file foo.nc}, already exists then by default the existing file will be moved to \texttt{foo.nc\~} and the new time series will go into \texttt{foo.nc}.  To append the time series onto the end of the existing file, use option \texttt{-extra_append}.

Note that this mechanism modifies PISM's adaptive time-stepping scheme to save
\emph{exactly} at the times requested (instead of using linear interpolation).

\subsection{Saving re-startable snapshots of the model state}\index{snapshots of the model state}\index{PISM!saving snapshots of the model state}
\label{sec:snapshots}
\optsection{Saving snapshots}
Sometimes you want to check the model state every 1000 years, for example.  One possible solution is to run PISM for a thousand years, have it save all the fields at the end of the run, then restart and run for another thousand, and etc.  This forces the adaptive time-stepping mechanism to stop \emph{exactly} at multiples of 1000 years, which may be desirable in some cases.

By default re-startable snapshots contain only the variables needed for
restarting PISM. Use the command-line option \texttt{-save_size} to change what is saved.

If saving exactly at specified times is not critical, then use the \texttt{-save_file} and \texttt{-save_times} options.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
$ pismr -i foo.nc -y 10000 -o output.nc -save_file snapshots.nc \
        -save_times 1000:1000:10000
\end{verbatim}
starts a PISM evolution run, initializing from \texttt{foo.nc}, running for
10000 years and saving snapshots to \texttt{snapshots.nc} at the first time-step
after each of the years 1000, 2000, \dots, 10000.

We use a MATLAB-style range specification, $a:\Delta t:b$, where $a,\Delta t,b$ are in years.  The time-stepping scheme is not affected, but as a consequence we do not guarantee producing the exact number of snapshots requested if the requested save times have spacing comparable to the model time-steps.  This is not a problem in the typical case in which snapshot spacing is much greater than the length of a typical timestep.

It is also possible to save snapshots at intervals that are not equally-spaced
by giving the \texttt{-save_times} option a comma-separated list. For example,
\begin{verbatim}
$ pismr -i foo.nc -y 10000 -o output.nc -save_file snapshots.nc \
        -save_times 1000,1500,2000,5000
\end{verbatim}
will save snapshots on the first time-step after years 1000, 1500, 2000 and 5000.
The comma-separated list given to the \texttt{-save_times} option can be at most 200 numbers long.

If \texttt{snapshots.nc} was created by the command above, running
\begin{verbatim}
$ pismr -i snapshots.nc -y 1000 -o output_2.nc
\end{verbatim}
will initialize using the last record in the file, at about $5000$ years.  By contrast, to restart from $1500$ years (for example) it is necessary to extract the corresponding record using \texttt{ncks}\index{NCO (NetCDF Operators)!ncks}
\begin{verbatim}
$ ncks -d t,1500years snapshots.nc foo.nc
\end{verbatim}
and then restart from \texttt{foo.nc}.  Note that \texttt{-d t,N} means ``extract the $N$-th record'' (counting from zero).  So, this command is equivalent to
\begin{verbatim}
$ ncks -d t,1 snapshots.nc foo.nc
\end{verbatim}
Also note that the second snapshot will probably be \emph{around} $1500$ years and \texttt{ncks} handles this correctly: it takes the record closest to $1500$ years.

Another possible use of snapshots is for restarting runs on a batch system which kills jobs which go over their allotted time.  Running PISM with options \texttt{-y 1500} \texttt{-save_times 1000:100:1400} would mean that if the job is killed before completing the whole 1500 year run, we can restart from near the last multiple of $100$ years.  Restarting with option \texttt{-ye} would finish the run on the desired year.

When running PISM on such a batch system it is also possible to save
re-startable snapshots at equal wall-clock time (as opposed to model time)
intervals by adding the '\txtopt{backup_interval}{hours}' option.

\textbf{A note of caution:} if the wall-clock limit is equal to $N$ times backup
interval for a whole number $N$ PISM will likely get killed while writing the
last backup.

It is also possible to save snapshots to separate files using the
\texttt{-save_split} option.  For example, the run above can be changed to
\begin{verbatim}
$ pismr -i foo.nc -y 10000 -o output.nc -save_file snapshots \
        -save_times 1000,1500,2000,5000 -save_split
\end{verbatim}
for this purpose.  This will produce files called
\texttt{snapshots-}year\texttt{.nc}.  This option is generally faster if many
snapshots are needed, apparently because of the time necessary to reopen a
large file at each snapshot when \texttt{-save_split} is not used.  Note
that tools like NCO\index{NCO (NetCDF Operators)!wildcards} and
\texttt{ncview}\index{NetCDF!tools!work with wildcards} usually behave as desired with wildcards like ``\texttt{snapshots-*.nc}''.

Table \ref{tab:snapshot-opts} lists the options related to saving snapshots of the model state.

shows the dependence of the ice temperature on $z$ (more precisely, on the
number of the vertical grid layer) at the center of the domain. One can use options \texttt{-id} and \texttt{-jd} to choose a different point.

Related to soundings, one can expose all the linear systems being solved in ice columns by using \texttt{-view_sys} along with the sounding location (\texttt{-id XX} and \texttt{-jd YY}).  For example, if the enthalpy formulation is in use then a \Matlab-format text file \texttt{enth_iXX_jYY.m} will be generated at each time step.  % FIXME:  add year to file name?
This text file can be run as a script in \Matlab.  The linear system will be stored in a matrix, a right-hand-side vector, and the solution in a solution vector.  This way these linear systems can be checked for debugging purposes.

\subsection{PISM's default flags and parameters (and how to change them)}
\label{sec:pism-defaults}
\optsection{PISM configuration file}

PISM's behavior depends on values of many flags and physical parameters (see
\href{http://www.pism-docs.org/doxy/html/index.html}{PISM Source Code Browser} for details). Most of parameters have default values\footnote{For \texttt{pismr}, grid parameters $Mx$, $My$, $Mz$, $Mbz$, $Lz$, $Lbz$, that have to be set at bootstrapping, are some exceptions.} which are read from the configuration file \texttt{pism_config.nc} in the \texttt{lib} sub-directory.

It is possible to run PISM with an alternate configuration file using the \fileopt{config} command-line option:
\begin{verbatim}
$ pismr -i foo.nc -y 1000 -config my_config.nc
\end{verbatim}

The file \texttt{my_config.nc} has to contain \emph{all the flags and parameters} present in \texttt{pism_config.nc}.

The list of parameters is too long to include here; please see the \href{http://www.pism-docs.org/doxy/html/index.html}{PISM Source Code Browser} for an automatically-generated table describing them.

Some command-line options \emph{set} configuration parameters; some PISM
executables have special parameter defaults. To see the configuration used in a
PISM run, use the option \fileopt{dump_config}. The resulting file will have values
used, no matter \emph{how} they were set.

\subsection{Managing parameter studies}
\label{sec:parameter-studies}
Keeping all PISM output files in a parameter study straight can be a challenge.

If parameters of interest can be controlled using command-line options, one can use \texttt{ncdump -h} and look at the \texttt{history} global attribute.

Changing parameters not available at the command-line is also possible~--- by using a custom configuration file (see section \ref{sec:pism-defaults}). The problem is that this makes it hard to see which parameters were changed.

The \fileopt{config_override} command-line option provides an alternative. First of all, a file used with this option can have \emph{a subset} of flags and parameters present in \texttt{pism_config.nc}. Moreover, PISM adds the \texttt{pism_overrides} variable present in this file to the output file, making it easy to see which parameters were used to produce it.

Here's an example: suppose we want to compare the dynamics of an ice-sheet on Earth to the same ice-sheet on Mars.\footnote{This is an admittedly simplified example. One will surely need to change more than just the acceleration due to gravity for a real comparison.}

Running
\begin{verbatim}
$ pismr -i input.nc -y 1e5 -o earth.nc <other PISM options>
\end{verbatim}
produces the ``Earth'' result, since PISM's defaults correspond to this planet.

Next, we create \texttt{mars.cdl}, containing the following:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
netcdf mars {
    variables:
    byte pism_overrides;
    pism_overrides:standard_gravity = 3.728;
    pism_overrides:standard_gravity_doc = "m s-2; standard gravity on Mars";
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Notice that the variable name is \texttt{pism_overrides} and not \texttt{pism_config} above. Now
\begin{verbatim}
$ ncgen -o mars_config.nc mars.cdl
$ pismr -i input.nc -y 1e5 -config_override mars_config.nc \
        -o mars.nc <other PISM options>
\end{verbatim}
will create \texttt{mars.nc}, the result of the ``Mars'' run.

In this case, we can use \texttt{ncdump} to see what was different about \texttt{mars.nc}:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
$ ncdump -h mars.nc |grep pism_overrides
 byte pism_overrides ;
    pism_overrides:standard_gravity_doc = "m s-2; standard gravity on Mars" ;
    pism_overrides:standard_gravity = 3.728 ;
macbook:pism>
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize


\subsection{Visualizing climate inputs, without ice dynamics}
\label{subsect:pclimate}
\optsection{Visualizing climate inputs}

Recall that internally in PISM there is a separation of climate inputs from ice
dynamics (subsection \ref{sec:climate-inputs}). Executable
\texttt{pclimate} \index{executables!\texttt{pclimate}} allows one to visualize climate inputs without
invoking the ice dynamics core of PISM. This is helpful during the process of
creating PISM-readable data files, and modeling with such.

\texttt{pclimate} shares the code implementing climate models with other PISM
executables, so everything said in section \ref{sec:boundary-models} applies
here. In addition to \texttt{-atmosphere}, \texttt{-surface}, \texttt{-ocean}
and others, \texttt{pclimate} takes options listed in table \ref{tab:pclimate}.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{\texttt{pclimate} command-line options}
  \begin{tabular}{p{0.25\linewidth}p{0.7\linewidth}}\toprule
    \textbf{Option} & \textbf{Description}\\
    \midrule
    \fileopt{i} & specifies an input file, which has been produced by PISM;\\
    \fileopt{o} & sets the output file name;\\
    \txtopt{ys}{(years)} & sets the start time, in years;\\
    \txtopt{ye}{(years)} & sets the final time, in years;\\
    \txtopt{dt}{(years)} & sets the interval between saved climate snapshots.\\
    \bottomrule
 \end{tabular}
 \label{tab:pclimate}
\end{table}

\bigskip
As an example, set up an ice sheet state file and run \texttt{pclimate} on it:
\begin{verbatim}
$ mpiexec -n 2 pisms -eisII A -y 1000 -o state.nc
$ pclimate -i state.nc -surface constant -ys 0.0 -ye 2.5 -dt 0.1 -o movie.nc
\end{verbatim}
Using \texttt{pisms} merely generates demonstration climate data, using
EISMINT II choices \cite{EISMINT00}.  \texttt{pclimate} extracts the 
surface mass balance \texttt{acab} and surface temperature \texttt{artm} from \texttt{state.nc}.
It then does nothing interesting, exactly because a constant climate
is used.  Viewing \texttt{movie.nc} we see these same values as from \texttt{state.nc},
in variables \texttt{acab}, \texttt{artm}, reported back to us as the time- and space-dependent
climate at times \texttt{ys:dt:ye}.  It is a boring ``movie.''

The excuse for the executable \texttt{pclimate} becomes clearer if we use a positive degree-day
model (subsection \ref{sec:boundary-models}).  The positive degree-day
model uses a variable called \texttt{precip}, and a calculation of melting, to get the
surface mass balance \texttt{acab}. 

Assuming that \texttt{g20km_pre100.nc} was created as described in section
\ref{sect:start}, running
\begin{verbatim}
$ pclimate -i g20km_pre100.nc -atmosphere searise_greenland \
           -surface pdd -ys 0 -ye 2.5 -dt 0.1 -o foo.nc
\end{verbatim}%$
produces \texttt{foo.nc}. Viewing in with \texttt{ncview} shows an annual cycle
in the variable \texttt{airtemp} and a noticeable decrease in the surface mass
balance during summer months (see variable \texttt{acab}). Note that
\texttt{artm} is constant in time: this is the temperature \emph{at the ice
  surface but below firn} and it does not include seasonal variations \cite{Hock05}.

See section \ref{sec:eismint-greenland} for another \texttt{pclimate} example.

\subsection{Regridding}
\label{sec:regridding}
\optsection{Regridding}
\optseealso{Bootstrapping}

It is common to want to interpolate a coarse grid model state onto a finer grid or vice versa.  For example, one might want to do the EISMINT II experiment on the default grid, producing output \texttt{foo.nc}, but then interpolate both the ice thickness and the temperature onto a finer grid.  The basic idea of ``regridding'' in PISM is that one starts over from the beginning on the finer grid, but one extracts the desired variables stored in the coarse grid file and interpolates these onto the finer grid before proceeding with the actual computation.

The transfer from grid to grid is reasonably general---one can go from coarse to fine or vice versa in each dimension $x,y,z$---but the transfer must always be done by \emph{interpolation} and never \emph{extrapolation}.  (An attempt to do the latter will always produce a PISM error.)

Such ``regridding'' is done using the \fileopt{regrid_file} and
\listopt{regrid_vars} commands as in this example: \index{executables!\texttt{pisms}}

\begin{verbatim}
$  pisms -eisII A -Mx 101 -My 101 -Mz 201 -y 1000 \
         -regrid_file foo.nc -regrid_vars thk,temp -o bar.nc
\end{verbatim}
\noindent By specifying regridded variables ``\texttt{thk,temp}'', the ice thickness and temperature values from the old grid are interpolated onto the new grid.  Here one doesn't need to regrid the bed elevation, which is set identically zero as part of the EISMINT II experiment A description, nor the ice surface elevation, which is computed as the bed elevation plus the ice thickness at each time step anyway.

A slightly different use of regridding occurs when ``bootstrapping'', as described in section \ref{sect:boot} and illustrated by example in section \ref{sec:eismint-greenland}.

See table \ref{tab:regridvar} for the regriddable variables using
\texttt{-regrid_file}.  Only model state variables are regriddable, while climate and boundary data generally are not explicitly regriddable.  (Bootstrapping, however, allows the same general interpolation as this explicit regrid.)

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Regriddable variables.\index{regrid}  Use \texttt{-regrid_vars} with these names.}\label{tab:regridvar}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}\toprule
    \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description}\\ \midrule
    \texttt{age} & age of ice\\
    \texttt{bwat} & effective thickness of subglacial melt water \\
    \texttt{bmelt} & basal melt rate \\
    \texttt{dbdt} & bedrock uplift rate \\
    \texttt{litho_temp} & lithosphere (bedrock) temperature \\
    \texttt{mask} & grounded/dragging/floating integer mask, see section \ref{subsect:floatmask} \\
    \texttt{temp} & ice temperature \\
    \texttt{thk} & land ice thickness \\
    \texttt{topg} & bedrock surface elevation \\
    \texttt{enthalpy} & ice enthalpy\\
    \bottomrule
    \normalsize
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Here is another example: suppose you have an output of a PISM run on a fairly
coarse grid (stored in \texttt{foo.nc}) and you want to continue this run on a
finer grid. This can be done using \texttt{-regrid_file} along with
\texttt{-boot_file}\index{refining the grid}:
\begin{verbatim}
$ pismr -boot_file foo.nc -Mx 201 -My 201 -Mz 21 -Lz 4000 \
        -regrid_file foo.nc -regrid_vars litho_temp,enthalpy -y 100 -o bar.nc \
        -surface constant
\end{verbatim}
In this case all the model-state 2D variables present in \texttt{foo.nc} will
be interpolated onto the new grid during bootstrapping, which happens first,
while three-dimensional variables are filled using heuristics mentioned in
section \ref{sect:boot}.  Then temperature in bedrock (\texttt{litho_temp}) and
ice enthalpy (\texttt{temp}) will be interpolated from \texttt{foo.nc} onto the
new grid during the regridding stage, overriding values set at the
bootstrapping stage.  All of this, bootstrapping and regridding, occurs before
the first timestep.


\newcommand\pid{\textsl{pid}s}

\subsection{Signals, to control a running PISM model} \label{subsect:signal} \index{signals} \index{PISM!catches signals -TERM,-USR1,-USR2}  Ice sheet model runs sometimes take a long time, so the state of a run may need checking.  Sometimes the run needs to be stopped, but with the possibility of restarting.  PISM implements these behaviors using ``signals'' from the POSIX standard, included in Linux and most flavors of Unix.  Table \ref{tab:signals} summarizes how PISM responds to signals.  A convenient form of \texttt{kill}, for Linux users, is \texttt{pkill} which will find processes by executable name.  Thus ``\texttt{pkill -USR1 pismr}'' might be used to send all PISM processes the same signal, avoiding an explicit list of \pid.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Signalling running PISM processes.  ``\pid''~stands for list of all identifiers of the PISM processes.}\label{tab:signals}
\begin{tabular}{llp{0.60\linewidth}}\toprule
\textbf{Command} & \textbf{Signal} & \textbf{PISM behavior} \\
\midrule
\texttt{kill -KILL} \pid & \texttt{SIGKILL} & Terminate with extreme prejudice. PISM cannot catch it and no state is saved. \\
\texttt{kill -TERM} \pid & \texttt{SIGTERM} & End processes, but save the last model state in the output file, using \texttt{-o} name or default name as normal.  Note that the \texttt{history} string in the output file will contain an ``\texttt{EARLY EXIT caused by signal SIGTERM}'' indication. \\
\texttt{kill -USR1} \pid & \texttt{SIGUSR1} & Allow process(es) to continue, but save the model state at the current time as ``\texttt{pism}\textsl{X}\texttt{-}\textsl{year}\texttt{.nc}''.  Time-stepping is not altered.  Also flushes time-series output buffers. \\
\texttt{kill -USR2} \pid & \texttt{SIGUSR2} & Just flush time-series output buffers.\index{signals!USR2} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Here is an example.  Suppose we start a long verification run in the
background, with standard out redirected into a file: \index{executables!\texttt{pismv}}

\begin{verbatim}
pismv -test G -Mz 101 -y 1e6 -o testGmillion.nc >> log.txt &
\end{verbatim}

\noindent This run gets a Unix process id,\index{signals!pid (process id)}, which we assume is ``8920''.  (Get it using \texttt{ps} or \texttt{pgrep}.)  If we want to observe the run without stopping it we send the \texttt{USR1} signal:\index{signals!USR1}

\begin{verbatim}
kill -USR1 8920
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Suppose it happens that we caught the run at year 31871.5.  Then, for example, a NetCDF file \texttt{pismv-31871.495.nc} is produced.  Note also that in the standard out log file \texttt{log.txt} the line

\begin{verbatim}
caught signal SIGUSR1:  Writing intermediate file ... and flushing time series.
\end{verbatim}
\noindent appears around that time step.  Suppose, on the other hand, that the run needs to be stopped.  Then a graceful way is\index{signals!term}

\begin{verbatim}
kill -TERM 8920
\end{verbatim}

\noindent because the model state is saved and can be inspected.



\subsection{Understanding adaptive time-stepping} \label{subsect:adapt}
\index{PISM!adaptive time stepping scheme}
\optsection{Adaptive time-stepping}

At each time step the PISM standard output includes ``flags'' and then a summary of the model state using a few numbers.  A typical example is
\small
\begin{verbatim}
 y SIA v$Eh d (dt=1.07878 in 2 substeps; av dt_sub=0.53939)
  SSA:     4 outer iterations
S  -3456.41429:  3.35908  2.1664   2748.786  271.2114
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\noindent The format of the third line, the summary, is simple:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
S         YEAR:     ivol   iarea     thick0     temp0
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
That is, we have the total ice volume, total ice area, and the thickness and basal temperature at the center of the computational domain.  A ``\texttt{U}'' line near the beginning of the standard output indicates the units.

The characters ``\texttt{ y SIA v\$Eh}'' at the beginning of the flag line give a very terse description of which physical processes were modeled in that time step.  Both the SIA and SSA stress balances were solved, and the latter, which is the most computationally-expensive, describes its nonlinear iterations.

Now we explain what the rest of the flags line, namely

``\texttt{d (dt=1.07878 in 2 substeps; av dt_sub=0.53939)}''

\noindent might mean.  Note that the PISM time step is determined by an adaptive mechanism.  PISM does each step explicitly when numerically-approximating mass conservation in the map-plane.  This, and the modeling of horizontal advection in conservation of energy and age evolution, requires such an adaptive time-stepping scheme \cite{BBL}.  The first character we see here, namely ``\texttt{d}'', is the adaptive-timestepping ``reason'' flag.  See Table \ref{tab:adaptiveflag}; ``\texttt{d}'' means that the time step was limited by the diffusivity of SIA mass conservation.  We also see that there was a major time step of 1.08 model years divided into 2 substeps of about 0.54 years.  The \intextoption{skip} option sets the maximum number of such substeps, but the adaptive mechanism may choose to take fewer substeps to satisfy numerical stability criteria.

    to mass continuity using the SIA.  The maximum recommended value for
    \texttt{-skip} is, unfortunately, dependent on the context.  The
    temperature field should be updated when the surface changes significantly,
    and likewise the basal sliding velocity if it comes (as it should) from the
    SSA calculation.\\

\subsection{PETSC options for PISM users}\label{subsect:petscoptions}
\optsection{PETSC options for PISM users}

All PETSc programs including PISM accept command line options which control how PETSc distributes jobs among parallel processors, how it solves linear systems, what additional information it provides, and so on.  The PETSc manual \cite{petsc-user-ref} is the complete reference on these options.  We list some here that are useful to PISM users.  They can be mixed in any order with PISM options.

Both for PISM and PETSc options, there are ways of avoiding the inconvenience of long commands with many runtime options.  Obviously, and as illustrated by examples in the previous sections, shell scripts can be set up to run PISM.  But PETSc also provides two mechanisms to give runtime options without retyping at each run command.

First, the environment variable \texttt{PETSC_OPTIONS} can be set.  For example, a sequence of runs might need the same refined grid, and you might want to know if other options are read, ignored, or misspelled.  Set (in bash):

\texttt{export PETSC_OPTIONS="-Mx 101 -My 101 -Mz 51 -options_left"}

\noindent The runs 
\begin{verbatim}
$ pismv -test F -y 100
$ pismv -test G -y 100
\end{verbatim}
\noindent then have the same refined grid in each run, and the runs report on which options were read.

Alternatively, the file \texttt{.petscrc} is always read, if present, from the directory where PISM (i.e.~the PETSc program) is started.  It can have a list of options, one per line.   In theory, these two PETSc mechanisms (\verb|PETSC_OPTIONS| and \verb|.petscrc|) can be used together.

% "-da_processors_x M -da_processors_y N" should not be documented in this sub-appendix
% because they do not work.  the reason is that IceModelVec2 and IceModelVec3 put 
% the Mx, My dimensions in different arguments to the DACreate commands

Now we address controls on how PETSc solves systems of linear equations, which uses the PETSc ``KSP'' component (Krylov methods).  Such linear solves are needed each time the nonlinear SSA stress balance equations are used (e.g.~with options \texttt{-ssa_sliding} and \texttt{-ssa_floating_only}).

Especially for solving the SSA equations with high resolution on multiple processors, it is recommended that the option \intextoption{ksp_rtol} be set lower than its default value of $10^{-5}$.  For example, 

\begin{verbatim}
$  mpiexec -n 8 ssa_testi -Mx 3 -My 769 -ssa_method fd
\end{verbatim}

\noindent fails to converge on a certain machine, but adding ``\verb|-ksp_rtol 1e-10|'' works fine.

There is also the question of solver \emph{type}, using option \intextoption{ksp_type}.  Based on one processor evidence from \texttt{ssa_testi}, the following are possible choices in the sense that they work and allow convergence at some reasonable rate: \t{cg}, \t{bicg}, \t{gmres}, \t{bcgs}, \t{cgs}, \t{tfqmr}, \t{tcqmr}, and \t{cr}.  It appears \t{bicg}, \t{gmres}, \t{bcgs}, and \t{tfqmr}, at least, are all among the best.  The default is \t{gmres}.

Actually the KSP uses preconditioning.  This aspect of the solve is critical for parallel scalability, but it gives results which are dependent on the number of processors.  The preconditioner type can be chosen with \intextoption{pc_type}. Several choices are possible, but for solving the ice stream and shelf equations we recommend only \t{bjacobi}, \t{ilu}, and \t{asm}.  Of these it is not currently clear which is fastest; they are all about the same for \texttt{ssa_testi} with high tolerances (e.g.~\texttt{-ssa_rtol 1e-7} \texttt{-ksp_rtol 1e-12}).  The default (as set by PISM) is \t{bjacobi}.  To force no preconditioning, which removes processor-number-dependence of results but may make the solves fail, use \t{-pc_type none}.


\subsection{Utility and test scripts} \label{subsect:scripts}\index{python scripts} In the \verb|test/| and \verb|util/| subdirectories of the PISM directory the user will find some python scripts and one Matlab script, listed in Table \ref{tab:scripts-overview}.  The python scripts are all documented at the \textsl{Packages} tab on the \href{http://www.pism-docs.org/doxy/html/index.html}{PISM Source Code Browser}.

\subsection{Experimental: coupling PISM to an external surface model}
\label{sec:surface-external}
\optsection{\texttt{pismebm}}

PISM's surface and atmosphere models described in section
\ref{sec:boundary-models} are admittedly simplified. (Moreover, PISM developers
do not claim to be experts in atmosphere, energy (or mass) balance modeling. We
are delighted to work with people who are, though.)

There are at least two ways of making PISM benefit from other modelers'
expertise: incorporating their code into PISM and running PISM and a
stand-alone surface model side by side, making them exchange information every
so often.

One possible approach is to run PISM for 1 year, save results. Run a surface
model using PISM's modeling results to produce new mass balance and
surface-temperature fields. Start PISM using these new fields, run for 1
year...

This method is very flexible and is known to work, but has several drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
\item PISM has to wait for a surface model to produce new boundary data,
\item stopping and re-starting PISM can be computationally expensive,
  especially on fine grids,
\item if a surface model is not written to work in parallel, this method wastes
  many processor hours when used on a batch system with a large number of
  requested cores.
\end{itemize}

PISM has an executable \texttt{pismebm}\footnote{``EBM'' can be interpreted as
  an ``external boundary model'' or ``energy balance model'' or...} created to
optimize coupling PISM to \emph{serial} models perform diagnostic computations
(i.e. computations that do not involve time-stepping).

The \texttt{pismebm} executable is equivalent to \texttt{pismr} in every respect related
to ice-dynamics, but ignores \texttt{-surface}, \texttt{-atmosphere} and all
related options.

It can run on 2 and more processors (use \texttt{mpiexec -n XX} with
\texttt{XX} $> 2$) and takes the following additional options:

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \caption{\texttt{pismebm} options}
  \begin{tabular}{lp{0.6\linewidth}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Option} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule
    \txtopt{ebm_command}{``command''} & specifies a command that runs an EBM, enclosed in double quotes,\\
    \fileopt{ebm_input_file} & the file an EBM will read from\\
    \fileopt{ebm_output_file} & the file an EBM will produce and PISM will read \texttt{acab} and \texttt{artm} from\\
    \listopt{ebm_vars} & list of variables PISM has to write to \texttt{-ebm_input_file}, defaults to \texttt{topg,usurf}\\
    \txtopt{update_interval}{years} & EBM update interval \\
    \txtopt{artm_lapse_rate}{$\gamma$} & the lapse rate for the \texttt{artm} variable, in degrees
    Kelvin per kilometer. Disables the code reading artm from the
    \texttt{-ebm_output_file} and uses PISM code for the lapse-rate correction. 
   \\\bottomrule
 \end{tabular}
 \label{tab:pismebm-options}
\end{table}

So, if "\texttt{ebm -i ebm_in.nc -o ebm_out.nc}" is the command running an EBM,
run something similar to
\begin{verbatim}
$ mpiexec -n 5 pismebm -ebm_command "ebm -i ebm_in.nc -o ebm_out.nc" \
  -ebm_input_file ebm_in.nc -ebm_output_file ebm_out.nc \
  -update_interval 10 [other PISM options]
\end{verbatim}%$
to use this code.

The command above will use $5-1=4$ processors to run the ice-sheet
model and the remaining (one) processor to periodically run an EBM.

In this particular case, an EBM will run at the beginning of the model
run (PISM will wait), then at year=5 (in parallel with PISM). At
year=10, PISM will read \texttt{acab} and \texttt{artm} produced by an EBM using data
corresponding to year=5 (waiting for an EBM to finish the computation
if necessary). At year=15 an EBM will run to compute B.C. that will be
read by PISM at year=20, etc.

So, as long as an EBM takes less time per computation than PISM takes to step
through $0.5$*\texttt{update_interval} years, PISM waits for an EBM exactly
once, at the beginning of the run.

Note that an EBM command executed by PISM can be a shell, Python, or any
other kind of script your system supports. This makes it possible to include
pre- and post-processing tasks in this script, avoiding source code
modifications that would otherwise be necessary to make PISM output files ready
to use with a particular model and vice versa.

You can find an example "fake EBM" Python script in the "\texttt{examples/coupling}"
directory of the PISM source tree, \texttt{examples/coupling/ebm}.

\subsection{Using PISM for flow-line modeling}
\label{sec:flowline-modeling}
\optsection{Flow-line modeling}

As described in sections \ref{subsect:coords} and \ref{subsect:grid}, PISM is a
three-dimensional model. Moreover, parameters
\texttt{Mx} and \texttt{My} have to be greater than or equal to three, so it is
not possible to turn PISM into a 2D (flow-line) model by setting \texttt{Mx} or
\texttt{My} to 1.

There is a way around this, though: by using the \intextoption{periodicity}
option to tell PISM to make the computational grid $y$-periodic and providing
initial and boundary conditions that are functions of $x$ only one can ensure
that there is no flow in the $y$-direction. (Option \intextoption{periodicity}
takes an argument specifying the direction: \texttt{none}, \texttt{x},
\texttt{y} and \texttt{xy}--- for ``periodic in both X- and Y-directions''.)

In this case \texttt{Mx} can be any number; we want to avoid unnecessary
computations, though, so ``\texttt{-Mx 3}'' is the obvious choice.

One remaining problem is that PISM still expects input files to contain both
\texttt{x} and \texttt{y} dimensions. To help with this, PISM comes with a
Python script \texttt{flowline.py} that turns NetCDF files with $N$ grid points
along a flow line into files with 2D fields containing $N\times3$ grid
points.\footnote{This script requires \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{netCDF3} or
  \texttt{netCDF4} Python modules. Please run \texttt{flowline.py --help} for a
  full list of options.}

Here's an example. The script below creates a minimal (and obviously
unphysical) dataset. It describes ice geometry (variables \texttt{thk} and
\texttt{topg}) and the boundary conditions required by the \texttt{constant}
surface model (variables \texttt{acab} and \texttt{artm}; see section
\ref{sec:boundary-models}). \footnote{We recommend creating more metadata-rich
  datasets; this script contains the bare minimum to make it shorter.}
\begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
from numpy import linspace, minimum, maximum, abs
import netCDF4

Lx         = 1000e3                     # 1000 km
Mx         = 501
topg_slope = -1e-4
thk_0      = 1e3                        # meters
acab_0     = 0                          # m / year
artm_0     = -10                        # Celsius

nc = netCDF4.Dataset("slab.nc", 'w')
nc.createDimension('x', Mx)

x    = nc.createVariable('x',    'f4', ('x',))
topg = nc.createVariable('topg', 'f4', ('x',))
thk  = nc.createVariable('thk',  'f4', ('x',))
acab = nc.createVariable('acab', 'f4', ('x',))
artm = nc.createVariable('artm', 'f4', ('x',))

x[:]    = linspace(-Lx, Lx, Mx);    x.units = "m"
topg[:] = topg_slope * (x[:] - Lx); topg.units = "m"

thk[:] =  maximum(minimum(5e3 - abs(x[:])*0.01, thk_0),0)
thk.units = "m"

acab[:] = acab_0; acab.units = "m / year"
artm[:] = artm_0; artm.units = "Celsius"

nc.close()
\end{verbatim}

The file \texttt{slab.nc}, created by this script, is not ready to use with
PISM. However, running
\begin{verbatim}
$ flowline.py -o slab-in.nc --expand -d y slab.nc
\end{verbatim} %$
produces  a PISM-ready \texttt{slab-in.nc}--- by telling \texttt{flowline.py} to
``expand'' its input file in the ``y''-direction.

Now we can ``bootstrap'' from \texttt{slab-in.nc}:
\begin{verbatim}
$ mpiexec -n 2 pismr -surface constant -boot_file slab-in.nc \
    -Mx 201 -My 3 -Lx 1000 -Ly 4 -Lz 2000 -Mz 11 -periodicity y \
    -y 10000 -o pism-out.nc
\end{verbatim}%$

To make it easier to visualize data in the file created by PISM, ``collapse'' it:
\begin{verbatim}
$ flowline.py -o slab-out.nc --collapse -d y pism-out.nc
\end{verbatim}%$

\subsection{Managing source code modifications}
\label{sec:code-modifications}

``Practical usage'' may include editing the source code to extend, fix
or replace parts of PISM.

We provide both user-level (this manual) and developer-level documentation.
Please see source code browsers at \url{http://www.pism-docs.org} for the latter.

\begin{itemize}
\item To use your (modified) version of PISM, you will need to follow the
  compilation from sources instructions in the \emph{Installation Manual}
\item We find it very useful to be able to check if a recent source code change
  broke something. PISM comes with ``regression tests'', which check if certain
  parts of PISM perform the way it should.\footnote{This automates running
    verification tests described in section \ref{sect:verif}, for example.}

  Run ``\texttt{make test}'' in the build directory to run PISM's regression tests.

  Note, though, that while a test failure usually means that the new code needs
  more work, passing all the tests does not guarantee that everything works as
  it should. We are constantly adding new tests, but so far only a subset
  of PISM's functionality can be tested automatically.
\item We strongly recommend using a version control system to manage code
  changes. Not only is it safer than the alternative, it is also more efficient.
